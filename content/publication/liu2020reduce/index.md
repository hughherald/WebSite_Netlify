abstract: Objective. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) inefficiency indicates that
  there would be 10% to 50% of users are unable to operate Motor-Imagery-based
  BCI systems. Importantly, the almost all previous studieds on BCI inefficiency
  were based on tests of Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR) feature. In this work, we
  assessed the occurrence of BCI inefficiency with SMR and Movement-Related
  Cortical Potential (MRCP) features. Approach. A pool of datasets of resting
  state and movements related EEG signals was recorded with 93 subjects during 2
  sessions in separated days. Two methods, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and
  template matching, were used for SMR and MRCP feature extraction, and a
  winner-take-all strategy was applied to assess pattern recognition with
  posterior probabilities from Linear Discriminant Analysis to combine SMR and
  MRCP features. Main results. The results showed that the two types of features
  showed high complementarity, in line with their weak intercorrelation. In the
  subject group with poor accuracies (< 70%) by SMR feature in the two-class
  problem (right foot vs. right hand), the combination of SMR and MRCP features
  improved the averaged accuracy from 62% to 79%. Importantly, accuracies
  obtained by feature combination exceeded the inefficiency threshold.
  Significance. The feature combination of SMR and MRCP is not new in BCI
  decoding, but the large scale and repeatable study on BCI inefficiency
  assessment by using SMR and MRCP features is novel. MRCP feature provides the
  similar classification accuracies on the two subject groups with poor (< 70%)
  and good (> 90%) accuracies by SMR feature. These results suggest that the
  combination of SMR and MRCP features may be a practical approach to reduce BCI
  inefficiency. While, 'BCI inefficiency' might be more aptly called 'SMR
  inefficiency' after this study.
