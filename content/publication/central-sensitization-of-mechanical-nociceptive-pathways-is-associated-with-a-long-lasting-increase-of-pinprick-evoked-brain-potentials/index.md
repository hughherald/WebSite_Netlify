abstract: Intense or sustained nociceptor activation, occurring, for example,
  after skin injury, can induce “central sensitization,” i.e., an increased
  responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system. A
  hallmark of central sensitization is increased mechanical pinprick sensitivity
  in the area surrounding the injured skin. The aim of the present study was to
  identify changes in brain activity related to this increased pinprick
  sensitivity. In 20 healthy volunteers, increased pinprick sensitivity was
  induced using high frequency electrical stimulation of the forearm skin (HFS).
  Mechanical pinprick stimulation (64 and 90 mN) was used to elicit
  event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The recordings were performed before,
  20 min after and 45 min after applying HFS. The contralateral non-sensitized
  arm served as control. Pinprick stimulation of 64 mN, but not 90 mN, applied
  in the area of increased pinprick sensitivity elicited a significant increase
  of a late-latency positive wave, between 300 and 1100 ms after stimulus onset
  and was maximal at midline posterior electrodes. Most importantly, this
  increase in EEG activity followed the time course of the increase in pinprick
  perception, both being present 20 and 45 min after applying HFS. Our results
  show that the central sensitization of mechanical nociceptive pathways,
  manifested behaviorally as increased pinprick sensitivity, is associated with
  a long-lasting increase in pinprick-evoked brain potentials provided that a 64
  mN stimulation intensity is used.
