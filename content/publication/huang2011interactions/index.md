abstract: "Neural mass model developed by Lopes da Silva et al. is able to
  describe limit cycle behavior in Electroencephalography (EEG) of alpha rhythm
  and exhibit complex dynamics between cortical areas. In this work, we extend
  Grimbert and Faugeras's work to study the dynamical behavior caused by
  interaction of cortical areas. The model is developed with the coupling of two
  neural populations. We show that various attractors, including equilibrium
  points, periodic solutions and chaotic strange attractors, could coexist in
  different ways with different value of the connectivity parameters. The main
  findings are that: (1) The stable equilibrium points only appear with a small
  value of the parameter. (2) While the alpha activities always exist for both
  two populations with proper initial conditions. Interestingly, the coexistence
  of the multiple alpha-to-epileptic activities implies the multiple coupling
  ways for these activities in phase. Two neuronal populations with epileptic
  activities could interact with multiple rhythms depending on their
  connectivity. (3) For particular interest, chaotic behaviors are identified in
  four regions divided by the connectivity parameter with the positive maximal
  Lyapunov exponent. The four types of chaotic attractors have their own
  structures, but all of them are related to the epileptic activities."
