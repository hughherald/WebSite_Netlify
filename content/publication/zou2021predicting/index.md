abstract: Pain sensitivity is highly variable among individuals, and it is
  clinically important to predict an individual’s pain sensitivity for
  individualized diagnosis and management of pain. Literature has shown that
  pain sensitivity is associated with regional structural features of the brain,
  but it remains unclear whether pain sensitivity is also related to structural
  brain connectivity. In the present study, we investigated the relationship
  between pain thresholds and morphological connectivity (MC) inferred from
  structural MRI based on data of 221 healthy participants. We found that MC was
  highly predictive of an individual’s pain thresholds and, importantly, it had
  a better prediction performance than regional structural features. We also
  identified a number of most predictive MC features and confirmed the crucial
  role of the prefrontal cortex in the determination of pain sensitivity. These
  results suggest the potential of using structural MRI-based MC to predict an
  individual’s pain sensitivity in clinical settings, and hence this study has
  important implications for diagnosis and treatment of pain.
