abstract: In this paper, we proposed to utilize a novel spatio-spectral filter,
  common spatio-spectral pattern (CSSP), to improve the classification accuracy
  in identifying intended motions based on low-density surface electromyography
  (EMG). Five able-bodied subjects and a transradial amputee participated in an
  experiment of eight-task wrist and hand motion recognition. Low-density (six
  channels) surface EMG signals were collected on forearms. Since surface EMG
  signals are contaminated by large amount of noises from various sources, the
  performance of the conventional time-domain feature extraction method is
  limited. The CSSP method is a classification-oriented optimal spatio-spectral
  filter, which is capable of separating discriminative information from noise
  and, thus, leads to better classification accuracy. The substantially improved
  classification accuracy of the CSSP method over the time-domain and other
  methods is observed in all five able-bodied subjects and verified via the
  cross-validation. The CSSP method can also achieve better classification
  accuracy in the amputee, which shows its potential use for functional
  prosthetic control.
