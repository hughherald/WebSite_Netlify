abstract: In this paper, the problem of electrodes shift is studied in
  low-density surface electromyographic (sEMG) based prosthetic control with the
  proposed Sliding Window Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SW-NMF) algorithm.
  By artificially switching the electrode positions clockwise for Ï€/8, the 8
  channel sEMG signals of 10 gestures were recorded before and after the
  electrodes shift. It is found that electrodes shift makes the feature space of
  the sEMG signal non-stationary, which has a great influence on the classify
  accuracy. Besides, all kinds of existing algorithms for electrodes shift in
  the high-density electrode environment have limited effect in the low-density
  electrode environment. In the proposed SW-NMF method, we firstly place the sum
  constrain on the coefficient matrix H to reduce change of the sample
  distribution in the feature space. Secondly, a sliding widow strategy is
  applied accompany with the sum constrain on H to make the algorithm can be run
  online. Finally, a self-enhanced version of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  is included in the SW-NMF algorithm to make the classifier be able to follow
  the change of sample distribution in the feature space for further improve the
  decoding accuracy. Compared with the traditional TD+LDA, and the other type of
  NMF based methods, the result of the proposed SW-NMF shows a high robustness
  for electrodes shift.
