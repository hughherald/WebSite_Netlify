abstract: The neural oscillation in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is highly
  related to people's psychological cognitive ability. In this work, an OpenBCI
  version of phase-locked feedback control system has been implemented for real
  time alpha wave regulation. As compared with the distributed system
  architecture on Brainamp, PC and Arduino in the previous work, the new
  proposed system has integrated all the modules for signal acquisition, phase
  estimation and applying stimulation on one chip. Hence, the delay for signal
  transmission can be effectively eliminated, which leads to a better accuracy
  for phase estimation in phase-locked feedback control. The results show the
  effective of the proposed system to alpha wave regulation.
