abstract: "The development and application of new methods allow us to perform
  more advanced analyses on EEG signals. However, the understanding of the
  mathematical and methodological details about these new methods would be no
  easy for the researchers without engineering and mathematics background. As a
  collection of tools for EEG signal processing and data visualization, EEG/ERP
  analysis toolboxes make the researchers be able to perform the complex
  analysis by simply clicking buttons or running some lines of MATLAB script. In
  this chapter, we firstly make a brief overview about the currently popular
  toolboxes in EEG/ERP analysis, such as EEGLab, FieldTrip, BrainVision
  Analyzer, etc., and then focus on the introduction of Letswave, which is an
  intuitive and streamlined tool to process and visualize EEG data, with a
  shallow learning curve. Examples are provided for a better understanding of "
