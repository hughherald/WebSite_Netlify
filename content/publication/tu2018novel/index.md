abstract: Dimension reduction is essential in fMRI decoding, but the complex
  relationship between fMRI data and class labels is often unknown or not well
  modeled so that the most effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.) directions can
  hardly be identified. In the present study, we introduce a novel fMRI decoding
  approach based on an effective and general dimension reduction method, namely
  sliced inverse regression (SIR), which can exploit class information for
  estimating e.d.r. directions even when the relationship between fMRI data and
  class labels is not explicitly known. We incorporate singular value
  decomposition (SVD) into SIR to overcome SIR's limitation in dealing with
  ultra-high-dimensional data, and integrate SVD-SIR into a pattern classifier
  to enable quantification of the contributions of fMRI voxels to class labels.
  The resultant new SIR decoding analysis (SIR-DA) approach is capable of
  decoding behavioral responses and identifying predictive fMRI patterns.
  Simulation results showed that SIR-DA can more accurately detect e.d.r.
  directions and achieve higher classification accuracy than decoding approaches
  based on conventional dimension reduction methods. Further, we applied SIR-DA
  on real-world pain-evoked fMRI data to decode the level of pain perception and
  showed that SIR-DA can achieve higher accuracy in pain prediction than
  conventional methods. These results suggest that SIR-DA is an effective
  data-driven technique to decode behavioral or cognitive states from fMRI data
  and to uncover unknown brain patterns associated with behavior or cognitive
  responses.
