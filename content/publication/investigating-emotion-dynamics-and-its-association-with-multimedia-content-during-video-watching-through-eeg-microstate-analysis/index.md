abstract: "Emotions dynamically change in response to ever-changing
  environments. It is of great importance, both clinically and scientifically,
  to investigate the neural representation and evoking mechanism of emotion
  dynamics. But, there are many unknown places in this stream of research, such
  as consistent and conclusive findings are still lacking. In this work, we
  perform an in-depth investigation of emotion dynamics under a video-watching
  task by gauging the dynamic associations among evoked emotions,
  electroencephalography (EEG) responses, and multimedia stimulation. Here, we
  introduce EEG microstate analysis to study emotional EEG signals, which
  provides a spatial-temporal neural representation of emotion dynamics. To
  investigate the temporal characteristics of evoking emotions during video
  watching with its neural mechanism, we conduct two studies from the
  perspective of EEG microstates. In Study 1, the dynamic microstate activities
  under different emotion states and emotion levels are explored to identify EEG
  spatial-temporal correlates of emotion dynamics. In Study 2, the stimulation
  effects of multimedia content (visual and audio) on EEG microstate activities
  are examined to learn about the involved affective information and investigate
  the emotion-evoking mechanism. The results show that emotion dynamics could be
  well reflected by four EEG microstates (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4). Specifically,
  emotion tasks lead to an increase in MS2 and MS4 coverage but a decrease in
  MS3 coverage, duration, and occurrence. Meanwhile, there exists a negative
  association between valence and MS4 occurrence as well as a positive "
