abstract: Electrode shift causes high variability and non-stationarity in
  surface electromyographic (sEMG) patterns, which seriously impairs the
  robustness of sEMG-based prosthetic control in daily use. Existing methods for
  electrode shift are mostly suitable for high-density sEMG configuration and do
  not work well for low-density sEMG. Nowadays, a quantitative characterization
  of the influence of electrode shift on low-density sEMG and an effective
  classification method to handle the influence of electrode shift are still
  lacking. The present study first designed an experiment to produce electrode
  shift in an 8-channel sEMG recording system. By using tSNE and other
  quantitative indices, we observed that rotating electrodes’ position led to
  great changes in the TD feature space, which subsequently decreased the
  classification accuracy. Further, we showed that existing algorithms against
  electrode shift in a high-density electrode configuration have limited effect
  for low-density sEMG recordings. To combat the influence of electrode shift
  and to improve the classification accuracy, the nonnegative matrix
  factorization (NMF) algorithm was used to reduce the non-stationarity of sEMG
  features and the self-enhancing linear discriminant analysis (SE-LDA) method
  was adopted to update the classifier based on the changes of sEMG features
  space. Results showed that the NMF with SE-LDA method achieved an accuracy of
  70.58 ± 18.08% for the 10-motion classification problem with electrode shift,
  which was much higher than the accuracy of 54.84 ± 12.24% achieved by the
  classical TD features with the LDA classifier. The robust and effective new
  method against the electrode-shift problem has a great potential for the
  design of practical sEMG-based prosthetic control.
