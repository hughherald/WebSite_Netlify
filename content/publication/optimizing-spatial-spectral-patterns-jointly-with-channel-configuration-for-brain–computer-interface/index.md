abstract: The power of common spatial pattern (CSP) has been widely validated in
  electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain–computer interface (BCI). However, its
  effectiveness is highly dependent on subject-specific time segment, channel
  configuration and frequency band. Hence, the preprocessing procedure of CSP
  algorithm is critical to enhance the performance of BCI system. This paper
  proposes a feature extraction and selection method based on common spatial and
  spectral pattern for motor imagery brain–computer interface (BCI). We
  formulate the optimization of spatial spectral patterns, channel configuration
  and time segment as maximizing the proposed criterions including mutual
  information algorithm, Fisher ratio algorithm and wrapper method. The proposed
  method is evaluated on single trial EEG from dataset IVa of BCI competition
  III. The results show that best features are selected by a wrapper method and
  these features in cross-validation yield better performance compared to most
  of the reported results.
