abstract: Pain is a subjective first-person experience, and self-report is the
  gold standard for pain assessment in clinical practice. However, self-report
  of pain is not available in some vulnerable populations (e.g., patients with
  disorders of consciousness), which leads to an inadequate or suboptimal
  treatment of pain. Therefore, the availability of a physiology-based and
  objective assessment of pain that complements the self-report would be of
  great importance in various applications. Here, we aimed to develop a novel
  and practice-oriented approach to predict pain perception from single-trial
  laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). We applied a novel single-trial analysis
  approach that combined common spatial pattern and multiple linear regression
  to automatically and reliably estimate single-trial LEP features. Further, we
  adopted a Naïve Bayes classifier to discretely predict low and high pain and a
  multiple linear prediction model to continuously predict the intensity of pain
  perception from single-trial LEP features, at both within- and
  cross-individual levels. Our results showed that the proposed approach
  provided a binary prediction of pain (classification of low pain and high
  pain) with an accuracy of 86.3 ± 8.4% (within-individual) and 80.3 ± 8.5%
  (cross-individual), and a continuous prediction of pain (regression on a
  continuous scale from 0 to 10) with a mean absolute error of 1.031 ± 0.136
  (within-individual) and 1.821 ± 0.202 (cross-individual). Thus, the proposed
  approach may help establish a fast and reliable tool for automated prediction
  of pain, which could be potentially adopted in various basic and clinical
  applications.
