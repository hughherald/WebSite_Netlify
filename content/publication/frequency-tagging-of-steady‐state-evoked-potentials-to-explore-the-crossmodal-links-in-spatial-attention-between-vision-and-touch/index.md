abstract: "The sustained periodic modulation of a stimulus induces an
  entrainment of cortical neurons responding to the stimulus, appearing as a
  steady‐state evoked potential (SS‐EP) in the EEG frequency spectrum. Here, we
  used frequency tagging of SS‐EPs to study the crossmodal links in spatial
  attention between touch and vision. We hypothesized that a visual stimulus
  approaching the left or right hand orients spatial attention toward the
  approached hand, and thereby enhances the processing of vibrotactile input
  originating from that hand. Twenty‐five subjects took part in the experiment:
  16‐s trains of vibrotactile stimuli (4.2 and 7.2 Hz) were applied
  simultaneously to the left and right hand, concomitantly with a punctate
  visual stimulus blinking at 9.8 Hz. The visual stimulus was approached toward
  the left or right hand. The hands were either uncrossed (left and right hands
  to the left and right of the participant) or crossed (left and right hands to
  the right and left of the participant). The vibrotactile stimuli elicited two
  distinct SS‐EPs with scalp topographies compatible with activity in the
  contralateral primary somatosensory cortex. The visual stimulus elicited a
  third SS‐EP with a topography compatible with activity in visual areas. When
  the visual stimulus was over one of the hands, the amplitude of the
  vibrotactile SS‐EP elicited by stimulation of that hand was enhanced,
  regardless of whether the hands were uncrossed or crossed. This demonstrates a
  crossmodal effect of spatial attention between vision and touch, integrating
  proprioceptive and/or visual information to map the position of the limbs in
  external space."
