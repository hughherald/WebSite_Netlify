abstract: Alpha band oscillations are the most prominent rhythmic oscillations
  in EEG, which are related to various types of mental diseases, such as
  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. However,
  the dynamics of alpha oscillations, especially how the endogenous alpha
  oscillations be entrained by exogenous stimulus, are still unclear. Recently,
  a newly-developed phase-locked visual feedback (PLVF) protocol has shown
  effectiveness in modulating alpha rhythm, which provides empirical evidence
  for the further investigation of the neural mechanism of alpha dynamics. In
  this work, extensive numerical simulations based on four well-studied models
  were used to investigate the questions that (1) What kind of dynamic model
  exhibits a modulation phenomenon of PLVF? (2) What is the dynamic mechanism of
  PLVF for alpha modulation? (3) Which factors affect the modulation effects in
  PLVF? The result indicates that the dynamics of endogenous alpha oscillations
  are close to a simpler dynamic structure, like fixed-point attractor or
  limit-cycle attractor, which shows a global consistent dynamic behavior at
  different phases of the alpha oscillation. The further analysis explains the
  dynamic mechanism of PLVF for amplitude and frequency modulation of the alpha
  rhythm, as well as the influence of parameter settings in the modulation. All
  these findings provide a deeper understanding of the endogenous alpha
  oscillations entrained by exogenous phased locked visual stimulus and lead in
  turn to the refinement of a control strategy for alpha modulation, which could
  potentially be used in developing new neural modulation methods for cognitive
  enhancement and mental diseases treatment.
