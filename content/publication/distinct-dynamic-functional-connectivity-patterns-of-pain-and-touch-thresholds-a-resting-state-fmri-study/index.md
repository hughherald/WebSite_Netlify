abstract: Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis based on resting-state
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has gained popularity in recent
  years. Despite many studies have linked dFC patterns to various mental
  diseases and cognitive functions, little research has used dFC in the
  investigation of low-level sensory perception. The present study is aimed to
  explore resting-state fMRI dFC patterns correlated with thresholds of two
  types of perception, pain and touch, on an individual basis. We collected and
  analyzed resting-state fMRI data and thresholds of pain and touch from 80
  healthy participants. dFC states were identified by using independent
  component analysis, sliding window correlation, and clustering, and then the
  thresholds of pain and touch are correlated with the occurrence frequencies of
  dFC states. A new permutation analysis is developed to make identified dFC
  states more interpretable. We found that the occurrence frequency of a default
  mode network (DMN)-dominated state was positively correlated with the pain
  threshold, while the occurrence frequency of a static functional connectivity
  (sFC)-like state was negatively correlated with the touch threshold. This
  study showed that the thresholds of pain and touch have distinct dFC
  correlates, suggesting different influences of baseline brain states on
  different types of sensory perception. This study also showed that dFC could
  serve as an indicator of an individualâ€™s pain sensitivity, which can be
  potentially used for pain management.
