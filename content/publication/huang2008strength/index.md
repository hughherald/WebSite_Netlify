abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of opinion formation by
  introducing a simple model with a certain community structure. To understand
  the strength of the community, we took a particular interest in a special
  problem of how the opinion of a small but cohesive community could persist or
  even be finally accepted by the majority of the society. Both simulation and
  analysis has been done in the absence and presence of noise. In the noiseless
  environment, assuming the population of the community is fixed, if the
  cohesion of the community reaches a certain level, then the phase transition
  will occur in the evolution process that the community will never be
  assimilated even if it can assimilate the other nodes in the network, which
  depends on the population of the community. On the other hand, in the presence
  of noise, the process of opinion formation seems more complex that two
  transition behaviors occur outside and inside the community as the noise level
  increases. And the outcomes of the evolution may be completely opposite under
  different noise conditions.
