abstract: Event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used in brain-computer
  interface (BCI) systems as input signals conveying a subjectâ€™s intention. A
  fast and reliable single-trial ERP detection method can be used to develop a
  BCI system with both high speed and high accuracy. However, most of
  single-trial ERP detection methods are developed for offline EEG analysis and
  thus have a high computational complexity and need manual operations.
  Therefore, they are not applicable to practical BCI systems, which require a
  low-complexity and automatic ERP detection method. This work presents a joint
  spatial-time-frequency filter that combines common spatial patterns (CSP) and
  wavelet filtering (WF) for improving the signal-to-noise (SNR) of visual
  evoked potentials (VEP), which can lead to a single-trial ERP-based BCI.
