abstract: Steady State Evoked Potential (SSEP) has been widely used in the
  clinical sensory diagnosis and brain computer interface. Through rapid
  repetitive stimulation, the response of SSEP mainly concentrated on primary
  sensory areas of the brain, and the response of cognitive component is
  attenuated greatly. The response frequency of SSEP varies with different
  sensory modality. At the rate of the 10Hz, the response of Steady State Visual
  Evoked Potential mainly concentrated on the occipital region. While the Steady
  State Auditory Evoked Potential has the main response around 40Hz. Hence, the
  cognitive response in SSEP has been investigated with visual and auditory
  stimuli in this study.
