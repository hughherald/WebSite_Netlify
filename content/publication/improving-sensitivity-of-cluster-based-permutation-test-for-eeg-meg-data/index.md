abstract: To solve multiple comparisons problems in EEG/MEG analyses,
  cluster-based permutation test is possibly the most powerful approach, while
  it also inherits the advantage of well-controlled family-wise error rate from
  point-level permutation test. Because the cluster-level statistics used
  accumulate statistical power of all points in a cluster, cluster-based
  permutation test has a much higher sensitivity for widespread clusters. In
  this study, we demonstrate that, when the threshold for cluster inclusion is
  inappropriately set, the existence of larger clusters lowers the sensitivity
  for detecting the presence of smaller clusters, because the influence of large
  clusters on permutation distribution is overlooked in previous studies.
  Further, we demonstrated that increasing the threshold for cluster inclusion
  can efficiently solve this problem and then proposed a new guideline for
  threshold selection in the cluster-based permutation test. Results on
  simulated data and real data show the proposed guideline can greatly improve
  the sensitivity of cluster-based permutation test for detecting small clusters
  while retaining the same family-wise error rate.
