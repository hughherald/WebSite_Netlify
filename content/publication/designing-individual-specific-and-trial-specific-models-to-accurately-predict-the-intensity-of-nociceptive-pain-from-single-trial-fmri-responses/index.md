abstract: Using machine learning to predict the intensity of pain from fMRI has
  attracted rapidly increasing interests. However, due to remarkable inter- and
  intra-individual variabilities in pain responses, the performance of existing
  fMRI-based pain prediction models is far from satisfactory. The present study
  proposed a new approach which can design a prediction model specific to each
  individual or each experimental trial so that the specific model can achieve
  more accurate prediction of the intensity of nociceptive pain from
  single-trial fMRI responses. More precisely, the new approach uses a
  supervised k-means method on nociceptive-evoked fMRI responses to cluster
  individuals or trials into a set of subgroups, each of which has similar and
  consistent fMRI activation patterns. Then, for a new test individual/trial,
  the proposed approach chooses one subgroup of individuals/trials, which has
  the closest fMRI patterns to the test individual/trial, as training samples to
  train an individual-specific or a trial-specific pain prediction model. The
  new approach was tested on a nociceptive-evoked fMRI dataset and achieved
  significantly higher prediction accuracy than conventional non-specific
  models, which used all available training samples to train a model. The
  generalizability of the proposed approach is further validated by training
  specific models on one dataset and testing these models on an independent new
  dataset. This proposed individual-specific and trial-specific pain prediction
  approach has the potential to be used for the development of individualized
  and precise pain assessment tools in clinical practice.
