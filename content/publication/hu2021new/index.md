abstract: The dominant approach in investigating the individual reliability for
  event-related potentials (ERPs) is to extract peak-related features at
  electrodes showing the strongest group effects. Such a peak-based approach
  implicitly assumes ERP components showing a stronger group effect are also
  more reliable, but this assumption has not been substantially validated and
  few studies have investigated the reliability of ERPs beyond peaks. In this
  study, we performed a rigorous evaluation of the test-retest reliability of
  ERPs collected in a multisensory and cognitive experiment from 82 healthy
  adolescents, each having two sessions. By comparing group effects and
  individual reliability, we found that a stronger group-level response in ERPs
  did not guarantee a higher reliability. Further, by simulating ERPs with a
  computational model, we found that the consistency between group-level ERP
  responses and individual reliability was modulated by inter-subject latency
  jitter and inter-trial variability. The current findings suggest that the
  conventional peak-based approach may underestimate the individual reliability
  in ERPs. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of ERP
  measurements should be considered in individual-level neurophysiological trait
  evaluation and psychiatric disorder diagnosis.
