abstract: This study focuses on a demonstration of differences between
  movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) during emergency and
  non-emergency situations. Two paradigms were designed for emergency and
  non-emergency situations. The necessary pre-processing and Laplacian spatial
  filter were used in the collected data. Then initial negative phase of MRCPs
  was extracted from scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in non-emergency situation
  and compared with that in emergency situation. Based on the data of
  non-emergency, a matched filter (MF) algorithm was designed and was used to
  detect the motor intention in two paradigms. The result shows a significant
  difference of the initial negative phase of the MRCP in two cases. In
  addition, if the MF algorithm based on non-emergency situation was used for
  emergency situations directly, there was a large difference in accuracy. The
  true positive rate was 60.57±14.79% in nonemergency while 44.29±5.73% in
  emergency. The result indicates that additional consideration should be given
  to emergency situation when designing algorithms or collecting data. So, we
  designed a new algorithm to solve this problem, which works better compared to
  simple MF. The algorithm effectively improves the true positive rate and
  reduces the false positive per minute.
