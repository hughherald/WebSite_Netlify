abstract: "Medication is the main approach for early treatment of herpes zoster
  (HZ), but it could be ineffective in some patients. It is highly desired to
  predict the medication responses in order to control the degree of pain for HZ
  patients. The present study is aimed to elucidate the relationship between
  medication outcome and neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and
  to establish a machine learning model for early prediction of the medication
  responses from EEG. Methods We acquired and analyzed eye-closed resting-state
  EEG data 1-2 days after medication from 70 HZ patients with different drug
  treatment outcomes (measured 5-6 days after medicaiton): 45
  medication-sensitive pain (MSP) patients and 25 medication-resistant pain
  (MRP) patients. EEG power spectral entropy (PSE) of each frequency band was
  compared at each channel between MSP and MRP patients, and those features
  showing sigificant difference between two groups were used to predict
  medication outcome with different machine learning methods. Results MSP
  patients showed significantly weaker beta-band PSE in the central-parietal
  regions than MRP patients. Based on these EEG PSE features and a k-nearest
  neighbors (k-NN) classifier, we can predicate the medication outcome with 80%
  ± 11.7% accuracy, 82.5% ± 14.7% sensitivity, 77.7% ± 27.3% specificity and an
  AUC of 0.85. Conclusion EEG beta-band PSE in the central-parietal region is
  predictive of the effectiveness of drug treatment on HZ patients, and it could
  potentially be used for early pain management and therapeutic prognosis."
