abstract: Recently, the synchronization issue in chaotic systems has become a
  hot topic in nonlinear dynamics and has aroused great interest among
  researchers due to the theoretical significance and potential applications. In
  this paper, complete periodic synchronization is considered for the delayed
  neural networks with discontinuous activation functions. Under the framework
  of Filippov solution, a novel control method is presented by using
  differential inclusions theory, nonsmooth Lyapunov method and linear matrix
  inequality (LMI) approach. Based on a newly obtained necessary and sufficient
  condition, several criteria are derived to ensure the global asymptotical
  stability of the error system, and thus the response system synchronizes with
  the drive system. Moreover, the estimation gains are obtained. With these new
  and effective methods, complete synchronization is achieved. Simulation
  results are given to illustrate the theoretical results.
