abstract: Pain is a highly subjective experience, and the availability of an
  objective assessment of pain perception would be of great importance for both
  basic and clinical applications. The objective of the present study is to
  develop a novel approach to extract pain-related features from single-trial
  laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) for classification of pain perception. The
  single-trial LEP feature extraction approach combines a spatial filtering
  using common spatial pattern (CSP) and a multiple linear regression (MLR). The
  CSP method is effective in separating laser-evoked EEG response from ongoing
  EEG activity, while MLR is capable of automatically estimating the amplitudes
  and latencies of N2 and P2 from single-trial LEP waveforms. The extracted
  single-trial LEP features are used in a Na√Øve Bayes classifier to classify
  different levels of pain perceived by the subjects. The experimental results
  show that the proposed single-trial LEP feature extraction approach can
  effectively extract pain-related LEP features for achieving high
  classification accuracy.
