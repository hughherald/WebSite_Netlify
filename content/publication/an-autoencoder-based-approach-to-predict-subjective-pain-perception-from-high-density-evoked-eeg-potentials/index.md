abstract: Pain is a subjective experience and clinicians need to treat patients
  with accurate pain levels. EEG has emerged as a useful tool for objective pain
  assessment, but due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of pain-related EEG
  signals, the prediction accuracy of EEG-based pain prediction models is still
  unsatisfactory. In this paper, we proposed an autoencoder model based on
  convolutional neural networks for feature extraction of pain-related EEG
  signals. More precisely, we used EEGNet to build an autoencoder model to
  extract a small set of features from high-density pain-evoked EEG potentials
  and then establish a machine learning models to predict pain levels (high pain
  vs. low pain) from extracted features. Experimental results show that the new
  autoencoder-based approach can effectively identify pain-related features and
  can achieve better classification results than conventional methods.
