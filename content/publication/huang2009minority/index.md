abstract: In this paper, we focus on the effect of a network’s structure on the process of opinion formation. Emphasis is placed on the minority’s opinion evolution in a community structured network, where the majority rule is applied to govern the evolution. A model is developed for theoretical analysis using the mean field method In this model, the connectionsaredenseinthecommunity,butsparseoutside.Abifurcationdiagramcanthus be constructed, which is also verified through experimental study. The phase transition in the evolution is also investigated. In addition, a further investigation shows that a larger group size would bring more advantage to the minority.
