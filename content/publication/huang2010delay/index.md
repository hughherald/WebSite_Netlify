abstract: In this article, we focus on the delay-dependent multistability in
  recurrent neural networks. By constructing Lyapunov functional and using
  matrix inequality techniques, a novel delay-dependent multistability criterion
  is derived. The obtained results are more flexible and less conservative than
  previously known criteria. Two examples are given to show the effectiveness of
  the obtained criteria. Furthermore, some interesting delay-dependent dynamic
  behaviors have been showed in a special case, for example, we find that there
  is the coexistence of stable equilibria and stable limit cycles in the single
  neuron. Also, when the neurons are coupled, then the stable patterns are more
  complex.
