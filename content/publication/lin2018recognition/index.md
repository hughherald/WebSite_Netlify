abstract: The ability of recognizing driving actions could help building a more
  advanced driving assitance system, and could even be applied in automated
  driving to improve the driving safety. In this paper, we investigate the
  offline recognition of three classes of driving actions (turning left, turning
  right and braking), based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. A simulated
  experiment was conducted to collect EEG data of participants. The proposed
  algorithm includes Wavelet Analysis and Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), to
  extract the discriminative features. The classification results were obtained
  using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The results yielded an average
  single trial classification accuracy of 70.25% for all subjects, showing the
  discrimination of different actions and the correlation between driving
  actions and EEG signals.
