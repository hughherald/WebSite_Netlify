abstract: This study applied a comprehensive electroencephalography (EEG)
  analysis for movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) and event-related
  desynchronization (ERD) in order to understand movement-related brain activity
  changes during movement preparation and execution stage of unilateral wrist
  extension. Thirty-four healthy subjects completed two event-related potential
  tests in the same sequence. Unilateral wrist extension was involved in both
  tests as the movement task. Instruction Response Movement (IRM) was a brisk
  movement response task with visual “go” signal, while Cued Instruction
  Response Movement (CIRM) added a visual cue contenting the direction
  information to create a prolonged motor preparation stage. Recorded EEG data
  were segmented and averaged to show time domain changes and then transformed
  into time-frequency mapping to show the time-frequency changes. All components
  were calculated and compared among C3, Cz, and C4 locations. The motor
  potential appeared bilaterally in both tests' movement execution stages, and
  Cz had the largest peak value among the investigated locations (p < 0.01). In
  CIRM, a contingent negative variation (CNV) component presented bilaterally
  during the movement preparation stage with the largest amplitude at Cz. ERD of
  the mu rhythm (mu ERD) presented bilateral sensorimotor cortices during
  movement execution stages in both tests and was the smallest at Cz among the
  investigated locations. In the movement preparation stage of CIRM, mu ERD
  presented mainly in the contralateral sensory motor cortex area (C3 and C4 for
  right and left wrist movements, respectively) and showed significant
  differences between different locations. EEG changes in the time and
  time-frequency domains showed different topographical features. Movement
  execution was controlled bilaterally, while movement preparation was
  controlled mainly by contralateral sensorimotor cortices. Mu ERD was found to
  have stronger contra-lateralization features in the movement preparation stage
  and might be a better indicator for detecting movement intentions. This
  information could be helpful and might provide comprehensive information for
  studying movement disorders (such as those in post-stroke hemiplegic patients)
  or for facilitating the development of neuro-rehabilitation engineering
  technology such as brain computer interface.
