abstract: Compared with the well learned amplitude-frequency characteristic of
  Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP), the effect of duty cycle is
  still unclear. In this work, the influence of duty cycle on SSVEP response is
  investigated in differnt frequency domains. The amplitude surface with the
  change of both frequencies and duty cycles is plotted. To get a stable
  response, the experiment arranged in 3 days, and each result is an average of
  12 repetitions. It is interesting that the results from power spectral density
  (PSD) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method are not consistent. In
  addition, the relation between the fundamental component and its second
  harmonic component with the change of duty cycle is quite different at
  frequency of 7Hz, 10Hz and 13Hz. Based on the amplitude surface, we try to
  configure the subject-specific SSVEP based BCI. The frequencies and duty
  cycles of the stimulus are selected corresponding to the higher SSVEP response
  in the amplitude surface. Cross validation results show a significant
  improvement in the performance for the adjustment of duty cycle.
