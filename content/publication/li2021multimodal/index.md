abstract: This study investigated electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during
  movement preparation and execution in stroke patients. EEG-based event-related
  potential (ERP) technology was used to measure brain activity changes.
  Seventeen stroke patients participated in this study and completed ERP tests
  that were designed to measure EEG changes during unilateral upper limb
  movements in preparation and execution stages, with Instruction Response
  Movement (IRM) and Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) paradigms. EEG
  data were analyzed using motor potential (MP) in the time domain and the
  mu-rhythm and beta frequency band response mean value (R-means) in the
  time–frequency domain. In IRM, the MP amplitude at Cz was higher during
  hemiplegic arm movement than during unaffected arm movement. MP latency was
  shorter at Cz and the contralesional motor cortex during hemiplegic arm
  movement in CIRM compared to IRM. No significant differences were found in
  R-means among locations, between movement sides in both ERP tests. This study
  presents the brain activity changes in the time and time–frequency domains in
  stroke patients during movement preparation and execution and supports the
  contralesional compensation and adjacent-region compensation mechanism of
  post-stroke brain reconstruction. These findings may contribute to future
  rehabilitation research about neuroplasticity and technology development such
  as the brain–computer interface.
