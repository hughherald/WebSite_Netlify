abstract: In this Letter, the multistability issue is studied for Bidirectional
  Associative Memory (BAM) neural networks. Based on the existence and stability
  analysis of the neural networks with or without delay, it is found that the
  2n-dimensional networks can have equilibria and equilibria of them are locally
  exponentially stable, where each layer of the BAM network has n neurons.
  Furthermore, the results has been extended to -dimensional BAM neural
  networks, where there are n and m neurons on the two layers respectively.
  Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity of
  our results.
