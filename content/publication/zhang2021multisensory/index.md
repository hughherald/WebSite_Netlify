abstract: The existence of nociceptive-specific brain regions has been a
  controversial issue for decades. Multisensory fMRI studies, which examine fMRI
  activities in response to various types of sensory stimulation, could help
  identify nociceptive-specific brain regions, but previous studies are limited
  by sample size and they did not differentiate nociceptive-specific regions and
  nociceptive-preferential regions, which have significantly larger responses to
  nociceptive input. In this study, we conducted a multisensory fMRI experiment
  on 80 healthy participants, with the aim to determine whether there are
  certain brain regions that specifically or preferentially respond to
  nociceptive stimulation. By comparing the evoked fMRI responses across four
  sensory modalities, we found a series of brain regions specifically or
  preferentially involved in nociceptive sensory input. Particularly, we found
  different parts of some cortical regions, such as insula and cingulate gyrus,
  play different functional roles in the processing of nociceptive stimulation.
  Hence, this multisensory study improves our understanding of the functional
  integrations and segregations of the nociceptive-related regions.
