abstract: By learning how the brain reacts to external visual stimuli and
  examining possible triggered brain statuses, we conduct a systematic study on
  an encoding problem that estimates ongoing EEG dynamics from visual
  information. A novel generalized system is proposed to encode the alpha
  oscillations modulated during video viewing by employing the visual saliency
  involved in the presented natural video stimuli. Focusing on the parietal and
  occipital lobes, the encoding effects at different alpha frequency bins and
  brain locations are examined by a real-valued genetic algorithm (GA), and
  possible links between alpha features and saliency patterns are constructed.
  The robustness and reliability of the proposed system are demonstrated in a
  10-fold cross-validation. The results show that stimuli with different
  saliency levels can induce significant changes in occipito-parietal alpha
  oscillations and that alpha at higher frequency bins responded the most in
  involuntary attention related to bottom-up-based visual processing. This study
  provides a novel approach to understand the processing of involuntary
  attention in the brain dynamics and would further be beneficial to the
  development of brain-computer interfaces and visual design.
