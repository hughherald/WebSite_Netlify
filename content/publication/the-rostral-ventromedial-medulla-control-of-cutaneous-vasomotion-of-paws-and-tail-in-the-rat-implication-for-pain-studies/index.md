abstract: Thermal neutrality in rodents is achieved by large cyclic variations
  of the sympathetic drive of the vasomotion of the tail and paws, the most
  widely used target organs in current acute or chronic animal models of pain.
  Given the pivotal functional role of rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) in
  nociception and rostral medullary raphe (rMR) in thermoregulation, two largely
  overlapping brain regions, we aimed at circumscribing the brainstem regions
  that are the source of premotor afferents to sympathetic preganglionic neurons
  that control the vasomotor tone of the tail and hind paws. A thermometric
  infrared camera recorded indirectly the vasomotor tone of the tail and hind
  paws. During the control period, the rat was maintained in vasoconstriction by
  preserving a stable, homogeneous, and constant surrounding temperature,
  slightly below the core temperature. The functional blockade of the RVM/rMR by
  the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.5 nmol, 50 nl) elicited an extensive
  increase of the temperature of the paws and tail, associated with a slight
  decrease of blood pressure and heart rate. Both the increased heat loss
  through vasodilatation and the decrease heart-induced heat production elicited
  a remarkable reduction of the central temperature. The effective zones were
  circumscribed to the parts of the RVM/rMR facing the facial nucleus. They
  match very exactly the brain regions often described as specifically devoted
  to the control of nociception. Our data support and urge on the highest
  cautiousness regarding the interpretation of results aimed at studying the
  effects of any pharmacological manipulations of RVM/rMR with the usual tests
  of pain.
