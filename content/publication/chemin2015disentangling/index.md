abstract: Disentangle rhythmic sensory-and motor-related brain activity in
  electroencephalographic signal is rendered difficult by the fact that both
  processes can be expected to elicit Steady-State Evoked-Potentials (SS-EPs) at
  the same frequencies. Previous behavioural studies have shown that when
  participants are asked to tap along a musical beat, their taps precede the
  actual occurrence of the beat by 30-50 ms. This phenomenon, referred to as
  mean negative asynchrony is smaller in musicians than non-musicians.
  Furthermore, in a pilot experiment (6 participants) we observed significant
  fluctuations in the tapping period, resulting in some amount of
  desynchronization between auditory input and motor output. Therefore, we
  investigated whether the fluctuations in motor output can be used as a
  “temporal signature” to disentangle sensory-and motor-related periodic brain
  activity. The EEG was recorded in 16 healthy participants while they tapped in
  synchrony with a periodic auditory beat. The onset of the taps was measured
  using a touch pad. In the original EEG signals, activity related to sensory
  processing can be expected to follow the strict periodicity of the auditory
  beat and, hence, to elicit an SS-EP concentrated at the beat frequency. In
  contrast, movement-related activity can be expected to exhibit temporal
  fluctuations following those of the actual tapping movement and, hence, to
  elicit a relatively attenuated SS-EP spread around the mean tapping frequency.
  We then applied a linear time warping function to the recorded EEG signals, so
  as to suppress the fluctuations in tapping onsets. In these time-warped
  signals, movement-related activity can …
