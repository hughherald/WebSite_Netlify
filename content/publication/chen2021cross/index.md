abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow users to make use of brain
  activity to control external devices directly for rehabilitation and
  enhancement of human functions. However, the inefficiency problem that a
  typical BCI system is unable to effectively decode EEG signals in some users,
  prevents BCI technology from benefitting all users. The proportion of
  inefficiency varies in the major BCI paradigms, among which Motor Imagery
  (MI)-based BCI achieves highest (10%-50%). Hence, the question arises as to
  whether other BCI paradigms, such as P300, could be substitutes for users who
  cannot be served by certain paradigm. In this work, a cross-paradigms BCI
  experiment, in which 93 healthy subjects executed BCI tasks including real
  movement and P300 for two sessions on separated days, was performed to answer
  the above question. Firstly, the highly correlation between the recognition
  accuracy in two sessions within subjects for both Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR)
  features (p = 4.47×10 -11 ) and P300 features (p = 2.17×10 -3 ) indicated the
  reproducibility of the subject-level BCI inefficiency in the two paradigms.
  Further analysis demonstrated no significant correlation between the decoding
  performance of the SMR and P300 features (p = 0.604). The results verified the
  feasibility of improving BCI decoding performance by replacing certain BCI
  paradigm with another one when users encounter the problem of BCI
  inefficiency.
