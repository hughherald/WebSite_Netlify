abstract: How to effectively and efficiently extract valid and reliable features
  from high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG), particularly how to fuse
  the spatial and temporal dynamic brain information into a better feature
  representation, is a critical issue in brain data analysis. Most current EEG
  studies are working on handcrafted features with a supervised modeling, which
  would be limited by experience and human feedbacks to a great extent. In this
  paper, we propose a practical hybrid unsupervised deep CNN-RNN-GAN based EEG
  feature characterization and fusion model, which is termed as EEGFuseNet.
  EEGFuseNet is trained in an unsupervised manner, and deep EEG features
  covering spatial and temporal dynamics are automatically characterized.
  Comparing to the handcrafted features, the deep EEG features could be
  considered to be more generic and independent of any specific EEG task. The
  performance of the extracted deep and low-dimensional features by EEGFuseNet
  is carefully evaluated in an unsupervised emotion recognition application
  based on a famous public emotion database. The results demonstrate the
  proposed EEGFuseNet is a robust and reliable model, which is easy to train and
  manage and perform efficiently in the representation and fusion of dynamic EEG
  features. In particular, EEGFuseNet is established as an optimal unsupervised
  fusion model with promising subject-based leave-one-out results in the
  recognition of four emotion dimensions (valence, arousal, dominance and
  liking), which demonstrates the possibility of realizing EEG based
  cross-subject emotion recognition in a pure unsupervised manner.
