abstract: "Measuring the amplitude of specific frequencies in the spectrum of
  the EEG signal is a technique that is increasingly used to study the cortical
  activities related to rhythmic activities, such as the processing of acoustic
  rhythms, or the performance of periodic movements (ie 1): the periodic
  activities appear as clear peaks that can be easily distinguished from
  background noise. However, many rhythms are not strictly periodic and rather
  have a period that fluctuates over time. The nearly periodic activities are
  blurred in the EEG spectrum, as the peaks are spread out to neighboring
  frequencies and add up to the background noise. Here, we introduce a
  time-warping method to align nearly-periodic EEG signals on a constant period
  and therefore concentrate the signal in the frequency spectrum."
