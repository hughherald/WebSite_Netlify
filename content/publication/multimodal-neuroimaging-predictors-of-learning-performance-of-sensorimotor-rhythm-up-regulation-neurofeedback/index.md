abstract: "Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) is a popular
  neuromodulation method to help one selectively enhance or inhibit his/her
  brain activities by means of real-time visual or auditory feedback of EEG
  signals. Sensory motor rhythm (SMR) NFB protocol has been applied to improve
  cognitive performance, but a large proportion of participants failed to
  self-regulate their brain activities and could not benefit from NFB training.
  Therefore, it is important to identify the neural predictors of SMR
  up-regulation NFB training performance for a better understanding the
  mechanisms of individual difference in SMR NFB. Twenty-seven healthy
  participants (12 males, age: 23.1 Â± 2.36) were enrolled to complete three
  sessions of SMR up-regulation NFB training and collection of multimodal
  neuroimaging data [resting-state EEG, structural magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI), and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)]. Correlation analyses were
  performed between within-session NFB learning index and anatomical and
  functional brain features extracted from multimodal neuroimaging data, in
  order to identify the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological predictors for
  NFB learning performance. Lastly, machine learning models were trained to
  predict NFB learning performance using features from each modality as well as
  multimodal features. According to our results, most participants were able to
  successfully increase the SMR power and the NFB learning performance was
  significantly correlated with a set of neuroimaging features, including
  resting-state EEG powers, gray/white matter volumes from MRI, regional and
  functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state fMRI. Importantly, results of
  prediction analysis indicate that NFB learning index can be better predicted
  using multimodal features compared with features of single modality. In
  conclusion, this study highlights the importance of multimodal neuroimaging
  technique as a tool to explain the individual difference in within-session NFB
  learning performance, and could provide a theoretical framework for early
  identification of individuals who cannot benefit from NFB training."
