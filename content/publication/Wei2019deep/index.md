abstract: In recent years，deep learning algorithms have been developed
  rapidly，and they are becoming a powerful tool in biomedical engineering．
  Especially，there has been an increasing focus on the use of deep learning
  algorithms for decoding physiological，psychological or pathological states of
  the brain from EEG．This paper overviews current applications of deep learning
  algorithms in various EEG decoding tasks，and introduces commonly used
  algorithms，typical application scenarios，important progresses and existing
  problems． Firstly，we briefly describe the basic principles of deep learning
  algorithms used in EEG decoding，including convolutional neural network，deep
  belief network，auto-encoder and recurrent neural network． Then this paper
  discusses existing applications of deep learning on EEG，including
  brain-computer interfaces，cognitive neuroscience and diagnosis of brain
  disorders． Finally，this paper outlines some key issues that need to be
  addressed in future applications of deep learning for EEG decoding，such as
  parameter selection，computational complexity，and the capability of
  generalization．
