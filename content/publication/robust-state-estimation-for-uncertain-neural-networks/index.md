abstract: "The robust state estimation problem for uncertain neural network is
  studied in this paper. As the uncertainty of the parameter, the states of the
  estimator can’t be complete synchronous with the neural network,
  but   asymptotically synchronous with errorbound is accessible. For given
  state   estimator gain matrix, the error bound is derived. By using stable
  theory and linear matrix inequality approach, the design of the robust state
  estimator is also given in this paper. And the discussion of the estimate of
  the error bound is also presented. The simulation samples have proved the
  effectiveness of the conclusion. "
