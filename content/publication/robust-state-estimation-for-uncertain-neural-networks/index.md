abstract: "The robust state estimation problem for uncertain neural network is
  studied in this paper. As the uncertainty of the parameter, the states of the
  estimator can’t be complete synchronous with the neural network, but
  asymptotically synchronous with errorbound is accessible. For given state
  estimator gain matrix, the error bound is derived. By using stable theory and
  linear matrix inequality approach, the design of the robust state estimator is
  also given in this paper. And the discussion of the estimate of the error
  bound is also presented. The simulation samples have proved the effectiveness
  of the conclusion. "
