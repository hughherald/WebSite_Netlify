abstract: In this paper, the multistability is studied for two-dimensional
  neural networks with multilevel activation functions. And it is showed that
  the system has n2 isolated equilibrium points which are locally exponentially
  stable, where the activation function has n segments. Furthermore, evoked by
  periodic external input, n2 periodic orbits which are locally exponentially
  attractive, can be found. And these results are extended to k-neuron networks,
  which is really enlarge the capacity of the associative memories. Examples and
  simulation results are used to illustrate the theory.
