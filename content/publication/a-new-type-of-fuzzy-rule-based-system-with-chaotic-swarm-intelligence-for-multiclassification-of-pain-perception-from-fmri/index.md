abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly used in decoding brain states
  from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). One important application
  is to classify the levels of pain perception from patients' fMRI for clinical
  pain assessment. However, the huge number of fMRI features and the complex
  relationships between fMRI and pain levels affect the performance of pain
  classification models heavily. In this article, we introduce a new
  fuzzy-rule-based hybrid optimization approach for dimension reduction and
  multiclassification problems using chaotic map, crow search optimization
  (CSO), and self-organizing fuzzy logic prototype (SOFLP). The approach is
  named as CCSO-SOFLP. In the proposed approach, chaotic map-based CSO is
  employed to find the optimal features from ultra-high-dimensional fMRI, and
  the fuzzy-rule-based SOFLP is employed for multiclassification of pain levels.
  In this sense, CSO is provided to avoid being stuck in local minima and to
  increase the computational performance. On the other hand, multilayer SOFLP
  classifier can continuously learn from new data and identify prototypes from
  the observed data and use them to build fuzzy rules, to define a suitable
  local area for each prototype, and to avoid overlapping. The proposed approach
  is applied on a pain-evoked fMRI data set to classify the levels of pain.
  Results indicate that the proposed approach can decode levels of pain and
  identify predictive fMRI patterns with higher accuracy and convergence speed
  and shorter execution time. Therefore, the new type of fuzzy-rule-based system
  with chaotic swarm intelligence holds great potential to predict pain
  perception in clinical uses.
