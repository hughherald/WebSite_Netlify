abstract: This paper studies an unsupervised approach for online adaptation of
  electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain–computer interface (BCI). The approach
  is based on the fuzzy C‐means (FCM) algorithm. It can be used to improve the
  adaptability of BCIs to the change in brain states by online updating the
  linear discriminant analysis classifier. In order to evaluate the performance
  of the proposed approach, we applied it to a set of simulation data and
  compared with other unsupervised adaptation algorithms. The results show that
  the FCM‐based algorithm can achieve a desirable capability in adapting to
  changes and discovering class information from unlabeled data. The algorithm
  has also been tested by the real EEG data recorded in experiments in our
  laboratory and the data from other sources (set IIb of the BCI Competition
  IV). The results of real data are consistent with that of simulation data.
