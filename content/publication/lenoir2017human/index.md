abstract: "The role of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in vibrotaction is
  well established. In contrast, its involvement in nociception is still
  debated. Here we test whether S1 is similarly involved in the processing of
  nonnociceptive and nociceptive somatosensory input in humans by comparing the
  aftereffects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation
  (HD-tDCS) of S1 on the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by
  nonnociceptive and nociceptive somatosensory stimuli delivered to the
  ipsilateral and contralateral hands. Cathodal HD-tDCS significantly affected
  the responses to nonnociceptive somatosensory stimuli delivered to the
  contralateral hand: both early-latency ERPs from within S1 (N20 wave elicited
  by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of median nerve) and late-latency
  ERPs elicited outside S1 (N120 wave elicited by short-lasting mechanical
  vibrations delivered to index fingertip, thought to originate from bilateral
  operculo-insular and cingulate cortices). These results support the notion
  that S1 constitutes an obligatory relay for the cortical processing of
  nonnociceptive tactile input originating from the contralateral hemibody.
  Contrasting with this asymmetric effect of HD-tDCS on the responses to
  nonnociceptive somatosensory input, HD-tDCS over the sensorimotor cortex led
  to a bilateral and symmetric reduction of the magnitude of the N240 wave of
  nociceptive laser-evoked potentials elicited by stimulation of the hand
  dorsum. Taken together, our results demonstrate in humans a differential
  involvement of S1 in vibrotaction and nociception."
