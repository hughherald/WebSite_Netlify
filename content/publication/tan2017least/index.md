abstract: Simultaneous collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising neuroimaging technique, which
  can provide high resolution in both spatial and temporal domain. Because EEG
  recorded in MRI scanners is heavily contaminated with gradient artefact (GA),
  removal of GA from EEG is a crucial step in EEG-fMRI data analysis. To date,
  the most efficient methods to remove GA are the average artefact subtraction
  (AAS) method and its extensions. However, these methods assume perfect
  synchronization between EEG and fMRI recording, which could be violated in
  practice. In this paper, a least across-segment variance (LASV) method is
  proposed for correcting EEG-fMRI desynchronization. Simulation and real data
  tests were conducted to check the performance of LASV method. The results
  suggested that the LASV method is able to efficiently correct EEG-fMRI
  desynchronization in both synthetic and real data, providing a powerful tool
  for improving the performance of GA removal for desynchronized EEG-fMRI data.
