abstract: Single-trial detection of evoked brain potentials is essential for
  many research topics in neural engineering and neuroscience. In present study,
  a novel approach, which combines common spatial pattern (CSP) and multiple
  linear regression (MLR), is proposed to for single-trial detection of
  pain-related laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). The CSP method is effective in
  separating laser-evoked EEG response from ongoing EEG activity, while MLR
  makes an automatic and reliable estimation of the amplitudes and latencies of
  N2 and P2 from single-trial LEP waveforms. The MLR coefficients are further
  used for the prediction of pain perception, which is of great importance for
  both basic and clinical applications. The prediction is performed with both
  binary (classification of low pain and high pain) and continuous (regression
  on a continuous scale from 0 to 10) outcomes. The results show that the
  proposed methods could provide reliable performance at both with- and
  cross-individual levels.
