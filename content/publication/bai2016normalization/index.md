abstract: An effective physiological pain assessment method that complements the
  gold standard of self-report is highly desired in pain clinical research and
  practice. Recent studies have shown that pain-evoked electroencephalography
  (EEG) responses could be used as a readout of perceived pain intensity.
  Existing EEG-based pain assessment is normally achieved by cross-individual
  prediction (i.e., to train a prediction model from a group of individuals and
  to apply the model on a new individual), so its performance is seriously
  hampered by the substantial inter-individual variability in pain-evoked EEG
  responses. In this study, to reduce the inter-individual variability in
  pain-evoked EEG and to improve the accuracy of cross-individual pain
  prediction, we examined the relationship between pain-evoked EEG, spontaneous
  EEG, and pain perception on a pain EEG dataset, where a large number of laser
  pulses (>100) with a wide energy range were delivered. Motivated by our
  finding that an individual's pain-evoked EEG responses is significantly
  correlated with his/her spontaneous EEG in terms of magnitude, we proposed a
  normalization method for pain-evoked EEG responses using one's spontaneous EEG
  to reduce the inter-individual variability. In addition, a nonlinear
  relationship between the level of pain perception and pain-evoked EEG
  responses was obtained, which inspired us to further develop a new two-stage
  pain prediction strategy, a binary classification of low-pain and high-pain
  trials followed by a continuous prediction for high-pain trials only, both of
  which used spontaneous-EEG-normalized magnitudes of evoked EEG responses as
  features. Results show that the proposed normalization strategy can
  effectively reduce the inter-individual variability in pain-evoked responses,
  and the two-stage pain prediction method can lead to a higher prediction
  accuracy.
