abstract: Statistics is a collection of methods that you can get answers to
  important questions from EEG signal analysis. In this chapter, we firstly
  introduced the descriptive statistical methods for presenting the result from
  the raw data. Furthermore, analysis techniques comprised of parametric
  strategies like t-test, ANOVA, regression, and nonparametric procedures, such
  as permutation test, are introduced with their implementation in MATLAB and
  SPSS. Selecting the right statistical procedures would be important in EEG
  signal analysis. Finally, we discussed the problem of multiple comparison,
  which may increase the probability for the researcher to get to false positive
  conclusion due to the multiple comparison and remains a challenge in
  statistical method.
