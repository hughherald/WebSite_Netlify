abstract: Compared with the conventional self-regulated EEG neurofeedback
  strategy, a closed-loop feedback strategy can provide a more precise and
  robust brain wave modulation. By detecting a participant's instantaneous phase
  of EEG alpha oscillation and delivering phase-locked visual stimuli to the
  participant, a new closed-loop feedback paradigm, named phase-locked visual
  feedback modulation (PLVFM), has been developed to modulate his/her amplitude
  and frequency of alpha oscillation. However, the underlying neurodynamic
  mechanism of the PLVFM technique is still not clear, which limits the
  developments of precise and individualized applications of this new neural
  modulation technique. In this study, a neural dynamical model based on the
  limit cycle attractor has been proposed for alpha wave simulation to explore
  the neurodynamic mechanism of PLVFM. Results show that the simulated dynamic
  behaviors are consistent with the real results of online EEG modulation. The
  external stimuli at a specific phase change the instantaneous radius and phase
  of alpha oscillation. The repeated phase-locked stimuli stabilize the alpha
  oscillation in a new trajectory in the phase space and further induce the
  change of the amplitude and peak-frequency of alpha wave. The current study
  improves our understanding of the visual-modulated alpha wave, which is an
  important step towards precise modulation of EEG activity for the modulation
  of sensory and cognitive states.
