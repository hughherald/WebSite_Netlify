abstract: Recording oscillatory brain activity holds great promise in pain
  research. However, experimental results are variable and often difficult to
  reconcile. Some of these inconsistencies arise from the use of
  hypothesis-driven analysis approaches that (1) do not assess the consistency
  of the observed responses within and across individuals, and (2) do not fully
  exploit information sampled across the entire cortex. Here, we address these
  issues by recording the electrocorticogram directly from the brain surface of
  12 freely moving rats. Using a hypothesis-free approach, we isolated brain
  oscillations induced by graded nociceptive stimuli and characterized their
  relation to pain-related behavior. We isolated 4 responses, one phase-locked
  event-related potential, 2 non–phase-locked event-related synchronizations,
  and one non–phase-locked event-related desynchronization (ERD), in different
  frequency bands (δ/θ-ERD, θ/α–event-related synchronization, and gamma-band
  event-related synchronization). All responses except the δ/θ-ERD correlated
  with pain-related behavior at within-subject level. Notably, the gamma-band
  event-related synchronization was the only response that reliably correlated
  with pain-related behavior between subjects. These results comprehensively
  characterize the physiological properties of the brain oscillations elicited
  by nociceptive stimuli in freely moving rodents and provide a foundational
  work to improve the translation of experimental animal findings to human
  physiology and pathophysiology.
