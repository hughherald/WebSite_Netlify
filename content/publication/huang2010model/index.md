abstract: In the motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research,
  Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is used widely as a spatial filter on
  multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Recently the overfitting
  effect of CSP has been gradually noticed, but what influence the overfitting
  is still unclear. In this work, the generalization of CSP is investigated by a
  simple linear mixing model. Several factors in this model are discussed, and
  the simulation results indicate that channel numbers and the correlation
  between signals influence the generalization of CSP significantly. A larger
  number of training trials and a longer time length of the trial would prevent
  overfitting. The experiments on real data also verify our conclusion.
