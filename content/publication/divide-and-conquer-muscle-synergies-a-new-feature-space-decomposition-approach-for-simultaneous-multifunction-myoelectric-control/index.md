abstract: Simultaneous multifunctional control based on surface electromyography
  (sEMG) is a key issue for natural and intuitive use of upper-limb prostheses
  in clinical and commercial applications. However, muscle synergies make
  simultaneous multifunctional control technologically challenging. In this
  study, we proposed a new feature space decomposition approach to alleviate the
  difficulty brought by muscle synergies for simultaneous control of hand and
  wrist movements. In the feature space decomposition approach, Gaussian mixture
  modeling (GMM) clustering is used to split the whole feature space into a set
  of Gaussian clusters, each consisting of samples with similar characteristics,
  to “divide-and-conquer” the complex muscle synergies. Then, a hybrid
  simultaneous control strategy, which consists of switch control of hand
  movements and proportional control of wrist movements, is performed in each
  cluster, instead of in the whole feature space. In the experimental study,
  sEMG signals were recorded during static and dynamic muscle contraction
  involving 2-dimensional wrist rotation (flexion-extension and radial-ulnar
  deviation) and 3 basic hand movement patterns (relaxing, fisting and
  grasping). Results show that, the new feature space decomposition approach can
  increase the accuracy for switch control of hand movement patterns from 90.10%
  to 96.62%, and can improve the correlation between true and predicted values
  of wrist rotation angular velocity from 0.71 to 0.84 (for wrist
  flexion-extension) and from 0.67 to 0.82 (for wrist radial-ulnar deviation)
  for proportional control of wrist. The proposed feature space decomposition
  approach has the potential to yield simultaneous multifunctional control for
  sEMG-based upper-limb prosthesis.
