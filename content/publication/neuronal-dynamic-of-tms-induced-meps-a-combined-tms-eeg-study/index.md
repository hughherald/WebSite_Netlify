abstract: The recording of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single
  pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor
  cortex (M1) is a widely used non-invasive technique to assess motor cortex
  excitability in humans. Recently, it was shown that the electroencephalogram
  (EEG) can be used to measure TMS-evoked brain potentials (TEPs). Following M1
  stimulation, TEPs consist of early latency responses maximal over the
  stimulation site, followed by later responses hypothesized to originate from
  frontal and temporo-parietal regions. Here, we characterized the relationship
  between TEPs and MEPs using machinelearning techniques, with the aim of
  exploring the functional significance of these brain responses and their
  relation to M1 excitability. Furthermore, considering that M1 excitability may
  be expected to vary spontaneously according to intrinsic fluctuations in
  neuronal excitation, we also examined whether the EEG signal measured before
  the onset of the TMS pulse is predictive of the elicited MEPs
