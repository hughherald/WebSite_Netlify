abstract: Investigators have suggested that innocuous somatosensory input is
  processed serially from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1)
  and then to other brain regions; whereas nociceptive input would project in
  parallel from the thalamus to S1 and other brain regions. Here, we test this
  hypothesis by assessing the effect of High-definition transcranial direct
  current stimulation (HD-tDCS) applied to the left S1 on the perception and
  event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by nociceptive and non-nociceptive
  stimuli delivered to the ipsilateral and contralateral hand. HD-tDCS was
  achieved using a cathode surrounded by four anodes (20 minutes; 1 mA).
  Nociceptive stimuli were pulses of radiant heat delivered to the hand dorsum.
  Non-nociceptive stimuli were short-lasting vibrations delivered to the index.
  Nociceptive and non-nociceptive ERPs were recorded immediately before and
  after HD-tDCS. After each stimulus, participants rated intensity of
  perception. Because HD-tDCS was expected to reduce the excitability of the
  left S1, we expected that the responses to non-nociceptive stimulation of the
  contralateral hand would be reduced as compared to the ipsilateral hand.
  Furthermore, we predicted that the responses to nociceptive stimulation of the
  contralateral hand would show a similar reduction if and only if S1
  constitutes an obligatory relay for nociceptive input.
