abstract: The efficacy of neurofeedback is a point of great controversy, because
  a certain proportion of users cannot properly regulate their brain activities
  and thereby fail to benefit from neurofeedback. To address the neurofeedback
  inefficacy problem, the present study is aimed to design and implement a new
  neurofeedback system that can more effectively and consistently regulate
  usersâ€™ brain activities than the conventional way of training users to
  voluntarily regulate brain activities. The new neurofeedback system delivers
  external visual stimuli continuously at a specific alpha phase, which is
  real-time decoded from ongoing alpha wave, to regulate the alpha wave.
  Experimental results show that the proposed training-free externally-regulated
  neurofeedback (ER-NF) system can achieve consistent (effective in almost all
  sessions for almost all users), flexible (either increasing or decreasing peak
  alpha frequency and alpha power), and immediate (taking or losing effect
  immediately after stimulation is on or off) modulation effects on alpha wave.
  Therefore, the ER-NF system holds great potential to be able to more reliably
  and flexibly modulate cognition and behavior.
