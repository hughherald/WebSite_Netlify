abstract: The dominant approach in investigating the individual reliability for
  event-related potentials (ERPs) is to extract peak-related features at
  electrodes showing the strongest group effects. Such a peak-based approach
  implicitly assumes ERP components showing a stronger group effect are also
  more reliable, but this assumption has not been substantially validated and
  few studies have investigated the reliability of ERPs beyond peaks. In this
  study, we performed a rigorous evaluation of the test-retest reliability of
  ERPs collected in a multisensory and cognitive experiment from 82 healthy
  adolescents, each having two sessions. By comparing group effects and
  individual reliability, we found that a stronger group-level response in ERPs
  did not guarantee higher reliability. A perspective of neural oscillation
  should be adopted for the analysis of reliability. Further, by simulating ERPs
  with an oscillation-based computational model, we found that the consistency
  between group-level ERP responses and individual reliability was modulated by
  inter-subject latency jitter and inter-trial variability. The current findings
  suggest that the conventional peak-based approach may underestimate the
  individual reliability in ERPs and a neural oscillation perspective on ERP
  reliability should be considered. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation of the
  reliability of ERP measurements should be considered in individual-level
  neurophysiological trait evaluation and psychiatric disorder diagnosis.
