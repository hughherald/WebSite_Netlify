abstract: "In this paper, an electromyography (EMG)-based handwriting
  recognition method was proposed for a latent tendency of natural user
  interface. The subjects wrote the characters at a normal speed, and six
  channels of EMG signals were recorded from forearm muscles. The dynamic time
  warping (DTW) algorithm was used to eliminate the time axis variance during
  writing. The process for template making and matching was illustrated
  diagrammatically. The results showed that no more than ten training trials per
  character could make an accuracy of above 90%. The recognition performance was
  compared in three character sets: digits, Chinese characters and capital
  letters."
