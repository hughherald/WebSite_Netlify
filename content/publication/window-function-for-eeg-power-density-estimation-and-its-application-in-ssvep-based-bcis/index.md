abstract: A high quality power density estimation for certain frequency
  components in a short time is of key importance in Steady-State Visual Evoked
  Potentials (SSVEP) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). In this paper, the
  effect of the window functions in SSVEP based BCIs is discussed. EEG signal is
  a typical color noise with a high energy of the low frequency component. The
  main findings are that (1) The spectral leakage for EEG signals has some
  regular patterns. An obvious oscillation with the corresponding frequency can
  be observed. The amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the growth of the
  frequency. A short analysis is also given for the leakage. (2) The leakage
  from the low frequency component can be effectively suppressed by the using of
  some windows, such as Hamming, Hann and triangle window; (3) By removing the
  influence of the leakage from the low frequency component with high pass
  filter, the classification results are mainly determined by the width of the
  main lobe. The rectangle window would have a better accuracy than Hamming,
  Hann and triangle window. Some windows constructed with a narrower main lobe
  width have a potential use in SSVEP based BCIs.
