abstract: Decoding subjective pain perception from functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI) data using machine learning technique is gaining a growing
  interest. Despite the well-documented individual differences in pain
  experience and brain responses, it still remains unclear how and to what
  extent these individual differences affect the performance of
  between-individual fMRI-based pain prediction. The present study is aimed to
  examine the relationship between individual differences in pain prediction
  models and between-individual prediction error, and, further, to identify
  brain regions that contribute to between-individual prediction error. To this
  end, we collected and analyzed fMRI data and pain ratings in a laser-evoked
  pain experiment. By correlating different types of individual difference
  metrics with between-individual prediction error, we are able to quantify the
  influence of these individual differences on prediction performance and reveal
  a set of brain regions whose activities are related to prediction error.
  Interestingly, we found that the precuneus, which does not have predictive
  capability to pain, could also affect the prediction error. This study
  elucidates the influence of interindividual variability in pain on the
  between-individual prediction performance, and the results will be useful for
  the design of more accurate and robust fMRI-based pain prediction models.
