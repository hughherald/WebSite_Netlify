  Methods

  We investigated the effect of cTBS delivered over M1 on the ipsilateral and contralateral M1 and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), somatosensory-evoked brain potentials (SEP) and TMS-evoked brain potentials (TEP) recorded from both hemispheres before and after cTBS.

  Results

  Our results confirm that the variable effect of cTBS can be predicted by the latency of the MEPs recorded before applying cTBS. Short MEP latencies were associated with an enhancement of the MEPs elicited by stimulation of the ipsilateral M1 whereas late MEP latencies were associated with a reduction of MEP amplitude. In contrast, there was a positive correlation between MEP latency and the change in the amplitude of the MEPs elicited by stimulation of the contralateral hemisphere. A similar relationship was observed between MEP latency and the effect of cTBS on the magnitude of …
